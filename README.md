## **Overview**
- Fitness Friend is a web app that can be accessed on mobile or desktop that allows users to create workout plans - containing their choice of lifts - with set, rep, and weight ranges that the user can track in the user tracker.
- Fitness Friend's dashboard displays a calendar of the current month highlighting all days the user has tracked lifts, links to the plan interface, and tracker interface - allowing for a simple yet effective user interface.
- Fitness Friend is an easy-to-use app that is useful to first-time lifters - intermediary lifters - and advanced lifters, in a space that is oversaturated with hyper-advanced lifting apps and simple apps with low usefulness. 
- IN SIMPLE: Fitness Friend** helps users create and track their workout plans, monitor progress, and receive recommendations for their next sessions.
